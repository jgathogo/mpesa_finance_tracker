```bash
flutter test -j 1 test/unit/features/categories/data/repositories/category_repository_impl_test.dart
```

The test `test/unit/features/categories/data/repositories/category_repository_impl_test.dart` has failed with compilation errors.

**The Problem:**

1.  **Conflicting Method Signatures in Mock:** The `MockIsarCollectionCategoryEntity` class attempts to implement both `IsarCollection<CategoryEntity>` and `Query<CategoryEntity>`. Both of these interfaces have `deleteAll` and `deleteAllSync` methods, but their signatures are different (e.g., `deleteAll(List<Id> ids)` vs `deleteAll()`). This leads to a conflict where the mock class cannot correctly implement both, resulting in "inherits multiple members named X with incompatible signatures" errors.
2.  **Incorrect Type Assignment for `where()` Method:** The line `when(() => mockCategoryCollection.where()).thenReturn(mockCategoryCollection);` is causing an error because `mockCategoryCollection.where()` is expected to return an object of type `QueryBuilder<CategoryEntity, CategoryEntity, QWhere>`, but it's being told to return `mockCategoryCollection` itself, which is a `MockIsarCollectionCategoryEntity` and does not implement `QueryBuilder`.

**Files in Question:**

*   `mpesa_finance_tracker/test/unit/features/categories/data/repositories/category_repository_impl_test.dart`

**Alternatives:**

1.  **Reintroduce and Correctly Mock `QueryBuilder`**:
    *   Instead of `MockIsarCollectionCategoryEntity` also implementing `Query<CategoryEntity>`, you would have a separate mock for `QueryBuilder<CategoryEntity, CategoryEntity, QWhere>` (like `MockQueryBuilderCategoryEntityWhere` from earlier attempts).
    *   Then, you would mock `when(() => mockCategoryCollection.where()).thenReturn(mockQueryBuilderWhere);`.
    *   On `mockQueryBuilderWhere`, you would then mock `when(() => mockQueryBuilderWhere.findAll()).thenAnswer(...)`.
    *   This approach requires careful mocking of the chained calls, ensuring that each mock returns the appropriate type for the next call in the chain.

2.  **Abstract Isar Interactions for Easier Testing:**
    *   A more robust solution for future testability would be to abstract the direct Isar collection interactions within `CategoryRepositoryImpl` behind a simpler interface. For example, create a `CategoryDataSource` interface that handles the direct `IsarCollection` operations (put, get, delete, query).
    *   Then, `CategoryRepositoryImpl` would depend on `CategoryDataSource`, and in tests, you would mock `CategoryDataSource` instead of directly mocking `IsarCollection` and `Isar` methods. This reduces the complexity of mocking Isar's chaining API in unit tests.
